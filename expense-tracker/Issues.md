# Issues & Improvements

To add something, just write a new bullet under **Open** — one line is enough.
When it's fixed, I'll move it to **Done** with the date and a short fix note.

## Done

- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Expense **Reels** — a fun, Instagram-style way to review a cycle's expenses.
  - _Fix:_ added a 6th bottom-bar tab. A centred picker at the top (‹ / › arrows, defaults to the current cycle) chooses the cycle and shows its total + count. Below it, expenses are full-screen cards you swipe vertically (scroll-snap), each with a big category icon, amount, category/subcategory, date and note, plus inline **Edit** and **Delete**. A live counter shows your position.

- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Edit screen Save/Cancel buttons were hidden behind the bottom tab bar.
  - _Fix:_ the edit modal now renders in a top-level portal above everything (z-index raised), so the buttons always sit above the tab bar.
- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Dashboard "this cycle" / "all-time" totals were too wide and caused horizontal scrolling.
  - _Fix:_ stat numbers now wrap, grid columns can shrink, and the app clips horizontal overflow.
- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Reports "Spent" / "Daily Average" were too wide; wanted cycle average instead of daily.
  - _Fix:_ same overflow fixes, and "Daily Average" is replaced by **Cycle Average** (total ÷ number of cycles).
- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Wanted to add a note alongside the category from chat, e.g. `1000 mobile, ayush`.
  - _Fix:_ text after a comma is now saved as the expense note; the part before is parsed for amount + category.
- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Wanted suggestions / autocomplete for categories & subcategories in chat (incl. typing `/`).
  - _Fix:_ a suggestion strip now appears above the input — type `/` (or 2+ letters of a name) and tap a chip to insert it.
- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** Overall UI felt basic; wanted a more modern, classy iPhone-like look.
  - _Fix:_ refreshed theme — indigo→violet gradients, softer dark palette, elevated cards with shadows, gradient buttons/bubbles, pill-highlighted active tab, gradient app title.
- ✅ **(2026-06-28)** A newly added category wasn't recognized when adding an expense (went to Uncategorized), and the edit screen had no visible Save button on phone.
  - _Fix:_ categories/subcategories now register an alias; parser also matches category names directly; chat reloads categories per entry; edit-modal footer pinned so Save is always visible.
